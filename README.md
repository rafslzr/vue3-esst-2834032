Vue.js offers developers a framework for building applications that lets them choose how deeply they want to apply the framework. In this course, instructor Ray Villalobos explores the fundamentals of Vue.js 3, then covers options for rendering, computing values, and creating components. Ray shows you how to install Vue.js 3 and set it up. He walks you through using templates, then goes into properties that enhance the way the library works. He discusses arrays and objects, as well as how to create dynamic classes with expressions. He goes into transitions, then steps you through creating components and component events. He demonstrates what you get when you install a project with the Vue CLI, including how to install the Vue Router. He shows you how to set up and build a real project, then goes into enhancing your app so you can feel more comfortable with the application API. In conclusion, Ray explains how to add new features to your application.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
